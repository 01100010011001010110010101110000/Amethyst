Amethyst
========

Tiling window manager for OS X similar to xmonad. Was originally written as an
alternative to [fjolnir's](https://github.com/fjolnir) awesome
[xnomad](https://github.com/fjolnir/xnomad) but written in pure
Objective-C. It's expanded to include some more features like Spaces support not
reliant on fragile private APIs.
